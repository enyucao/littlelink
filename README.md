# LittleLink 中文介绍
The DIY self-hosted LinkTree alternative. LittleLink has more than 100 branded button styles you can easily use, with more regularly added by our community in this repo and in [LittleLink Extended](https://github.com/sethcottle/littlelink-extended).

（注：我不会直接翻译英文内容，而是自己的体验，描述一下）

LittleLink类似LinkTree，但免费且更灵活。

### 🌞 Themes and Accessibility
LittleLink offers both `light` and `dark` themes right out of the box. If the default color schemes don't match your preference, you can easily customize them by updating the values in `skeleton-light.css` or `skeleton-dark.css`. For those who prefer an automatic adjustment, setting your CSS to `skeleton-auto.css` enables the theme to adapt based on the device's system settings. To enhance visual accessibility in both `light` and `dark` modes, buttons lacking sufficient contrast with the background are outlined with an inverse stroke to ensure visibility. While LittleLink emphasizes accessibility, it's important to acknowledge that not all brands incorporated into LittleLink achieve this standard. Branded buttons that come into LittleLink always retain the original essence of the brand and some branded buttons might fall short of optimal accessibility in terms of contrast.

### 🥇 Performance

![Performance](https://cdn.cottle.cloud/littlelink/PerformanceBlock.svg)

LittleLink epitomizes simplicity and minimalism. When evaluating the [LittleLink sample page](https://littlelink.io/sample/seth) (which mirrors a typical LittleLink setup for an individual) through tools such as [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-littlelink-io-sample-seth/17ex80ryq4?form_factor=mobile), showcases LittleLink's excellence with 100/100 in Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO. My initial vision for LittleLink was to craft it from the fundamentals. I chose [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) as the foundation, enabling me to create something minimal and quick, removing the unnecessary bloat you would get from using a large framework for a page that requires nothing more than simplicity.

### ☁️ Deploy

![Publish](https://cdn.cottle.cloud/littlelink/Deployment.svg)

No need for gulp, npm, or anything else to make LittleLink work—it uses the bare essentials. You can automatically fork and deploy LittleLink with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), or [Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify) using the button below. LittleLink is also easy to host through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or on your home lab server, CDN, or other frontend hosting services. To edit, all you need is a little basic HTML knowledge to add a link to the exisiting buttons or you can create your own. See our [adding custom buttons to your own fork wiki](https://github.com/sethcottle/littlelink/wiki/Adding-custom-buttons-to-your-own-fork). It's simple, promise. 🤞

#### 🐋 Docker

你可以考虑使用Docker,但如果你知道Nginx的基础配置，使用Docker多此一举。

如果使用Docker，推荐将LittleLink文件夹映射到外部，并考虑使用Repo进行版本控制。Drew将LittleLink封装为Docker内的/usr/share/nginx/html/， 推荐使用“-v <path2littlelink>:/usr/share/nginx/html/”，例如“-v /home/caoe/littelink:/usr/share/nginx/html/”.

• [Drew](https://github.com/davisdre) is building a [super simple Docker implementation of LittleLink](https://github.com/davisdre/littlelink).

Tim提供另一个思路，通过环境变量，配置想要的LittleLink按钮。而所有的环境变量，通过Docker Compose来维护。 但我个人不喜欢这种方式，我更喜欢自己修改html文件，所以没有尝试。

• [Techno Tim](https://github.com/timothystewart6) is building [LittleLink-Server](https://github.com/techno-tim/littlelink-server). Check out [his video](https://youtu.be/42SqfI_AjXU)!
